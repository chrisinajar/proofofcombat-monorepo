# GraphQL Code Generator
- The GraphQL Code Generator is used to auto-generate the types for both API and client
- It also generates hooks and code for the UI
- Any time we edit the GraphQL schema, we must run `yarn run generate` to update the generated types.
- We never manually edit the `types/graphql.ts` file in the server
- We never manually edit the `src/generated/graphql.tsx` file on the UI

See the "Never use graphql tag in the UI project" rule for details on the UI's auto generated hooks.
