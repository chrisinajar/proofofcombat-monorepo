description: Never use graphql tag in the UI project
globs: proofofcombat-ui/**
---
- Always write .graphql files in the UI project
- Never write inline graphql using the gql` tag
- Server code may use gql tag, but the UI must not
- Any time you edit any .graphql file you must generate types again in the UI project
- Always use the auto-generated hooks
- The command for running codegen is `yarn run generate`
