description: Always co-locate automated tests
globs: *test*
---
All tests should be co-located with the code they test. Do not use patterns like dedicated tests directories, instead all tests should be named after the file they test.

- Always co-locate tests next to the code they assert against
- Never use `__tests__` folders
- Always name tests using `[name].test.[ext]` format, where name and ext are replaced accordingly.
- All tests should be within their respective sub-project, there are no global tests

Example: `src/foo/bar.ts` should be tested by `src/foo/bar.test.ts`
